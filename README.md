# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Data
Neural Network to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

Your First Neural Network
Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

Instructions
Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
cd into the first-neural-network directory.
Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.
Create a new conda environment:
conda create --name dlnd python=3
Enter your new environment:
Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
Windows: >> activate dlnd
Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
Run the following to open up the notebook server:
jupyter notebook
In your browser, open Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the my_answers.pypython file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook and have taken a look at the rubric before you submit the project!
If you need help running the notebook file, check out the Jupyter notebook lesson.
